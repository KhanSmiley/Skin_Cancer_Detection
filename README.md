## Project Overview
The Alliance Skin Care Center project aims to revolutionize the early detection of skin cancer using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a user-friendly web application. This platform allows users to upload dermoscopic images to a CNN-based model that predicts various types of skin cancer, such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and others. The project seeks to enhance early diagnosis and provide a convenient way for doctors and patients to interact.
## Features
The main features of our project are:
- **Image Analysis**: Upload dermoscopic images for analysis and skin cancer prediction.
- **Appointment Booking**: Schedule consultations with dermatologists through the platform.
- **Location-Based Services**: Find nearby dermatologists on an interactive map.
- **Secure Communication**: Communicate with healthcare providers securely.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and easy-to-navigate design for all users.
## Technology Stack
The technology stack for this project includes:
1. **Front-End**:
   - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing interface.
   - Font Awesome for scalable vector icons.
2. **Back-End**:
   - Python with Flask for server-side logic.
   - JavaScript and Ajax for dynamic, asynchronous communication.
   - TensorFlow for machine learning.
3. **Database**:
   - MySQL for data storage.
   - Flask-Mail for email communication.
## Usage
- Once the project is set up and running, users can:
- Access the platform through a web browser.
- Upload dermoscopic images for analysis.
- Book appointments with dermatologists.
- View nearby dermatologists on the interactive map.
- Communicate securely with healthcare providers.
